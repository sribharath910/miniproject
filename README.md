Skin Cancer Detection with Deep Learning
This project uses Deep Learning to detect skin cancer from images, combining a CNN model and an easy-to-use Streamlit app.

What It Does
Detects whether a skin image is Cancerous or Non-Cancerous.
Lets you upload an image and get predictions with probability scores.
How to Use
Clone this repository.
Install the required libraries using pip install tensorflow keras numpy opencv-python.
Run the app: streamlit run app.py.
Upload a skin image to see the result.
Tools & Technologies
Python for coding.
TensorFlow/Keras for building the CNN model.
OpenCV for image processing.
Streamlit for creating the user interface.
This project is built as part of a learning journey into AI.
